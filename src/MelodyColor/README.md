# MelodyColor

MelodyColor is an audio visualization application built with Qt6 and QML. It uses the device's microphone to listen for audio and represents different semitones with unique colors.
The project is organized in a way that the business logic, including audio processing and frequency to semitone mapping, is handled by C++ code using Qt6, while the user interface and graphics are managed by QML. 
This allows for a clear separation of concerns, which makes the application easier to maintain and extend.
The audio processing will be done in a AudioColorProvider class in C++. This class will emit a semitoneChanged signal whenever it detects a new semitone, which the QML code will respond to by changing the color of the screen.


### Project structure:

- main.cpp: Sets up the QML application and exposes the AudioColorProvider class to QML.
- AudioColorProvider.h: Implements the AudioColorProvider class, which performs audio processing and emits a signal when the semitone changes.
- AudioColorProvider.cpp: Implements the AudioColorProvider class, which performs audio processing and emits a signal when the semitone changes.
- main.qml: Defines the user interface and listens for the semitoneChanged signal to change the screen color.
- qml.qrc: A resource file that contains the QML files used in the project.

## Qt Components which coul help achiving the project goal:

- **Qt Multimedia Module Classes:**
  - `QAudioRecorder`: You can use this class to record audio from the microphone.
  - `QAudioProbe`: This class allows you to monitor audio being played or recorded, which you can use to analyze the audio data in real-time.
  - `QAudioBuffer`: Represents a collection of audio samples with a specific format and sample rate. You might need to use this class when processing the audio data.
  - `QAudioFormat`: Stores audio stream parameter information. You might need to use this class when setting up the QAudioRecorder.

- **Qt Multimedia QML Types:**
  - `Audio`: If you want to give feedback to the user, you can use this type to play a sound.
  - `VideoOutput`: If you plan to show a video visualization of the sound, you can use this type.

- **Qt Audio Engine:**
  - `AudioEngine`: If you want to do more complex audio processing, like adding 3d audio effects, you might need to use this class.
  - `Sound`: You could potentially use this to define different sounds that correspond to different semitones.

It's great to hear that you've chosen to proceed with the Real-time audio visualizer, Recording Audio, and Integrate with MIDI devices tasks. Let's break these tasks down into strategic design decisions and smaller implementation steps.
[SYSTEM]
You are a well organized AI software development assistant, who does all the hard work. You participate on complete solution of a single software component that is a part of a larger C++/Qt software application. The goal is to create some kind of audio visualizer while maintaining the code in a separate halves - the bussiness logic part(more C++), and the user interaction part(more Qt/QML). You are responsible for the "Real-time audio visualizer" component. You are able to work in two modes - you will be assigned two types of tasks - to "Design", or to "Implement". A "Design" task is completed by developing a software design decision, including one or more "Implementation" task that you must create as an outcome of a "Design" task completion. An "Implementation" task an already designed software part that needs to be implemented, so for example also a function header with a TODO comment can be considered an "Implementation" task. For that reason, performing "Implementation" is limited to source code blocks entitled with the filenames of where that implementation belong - no other prose or verbosity is required around the implementation, since that part had already been took care of as a part of preceding "Design" task.
[USER]
    "Design Decision:" Decide on the visualizer design. You could use rectangles or bars for each semitone, with their height or width varying with the frequency's amplitude. Alternatively, you might want a more fluid design, like a wave.

As for the updates in Qt 6, here are some potential considerations:

    New QML types: You might be able to simplify your code by using the new QML types instead of writing wrappers or exposing instances of C++ classes.

    Deprecations and removals: If you were using QAudioRecorder or any of the other deprecated or removed classes, you'll need to replace them with the new equivalents.

    URL resolution: If your code depends on relative URLs being resolved immediately, you might need to use Qt.resolvedUrl to maintain the same behavior.

    Variant properties: If your code uses variant properties, you'll need to replace implicit string conversions with explicit creation of the correct type object.

    API changes: If you use QQmlListProperty's CountFunction or AtFunction, you'll need to adjust your code to use qsizetype instead of int.

    Removed APIs: If your code uses any of the removed functions, you'll need to replace them with the new equivalents. In particular, consider using declarative type registration instead of qmlRegisterType, qmlRegisterExtendedType, and qmlRegisterInterface.
